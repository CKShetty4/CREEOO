#  CREEOO 

CREEOO is a social networking app that helps people connect with others nearby based on their interests and professional profiles. Many current social media apps make it hard to find and interact with people in your area, especially when you’re at events or specific locations. As a result, users often miss out on valuable opportunities to meet new people or network professionally.

CREEOO solves this problem by using location-based services to show users who is nearby and shares similar interests. Unlike other apps, CREEOO allows users to discover and connect with the right people in real-time, making networking easier and more spontaneous. The app also provides digital visiting cards for quick and easy sharing of contact information, ensuring that important connections aren't missed.

This repository contains the frontend of the app, which I built using React Native with Expo. The user interface is fully integrated with the Go-based backend, allowing users to enjoy real-time messaging, voice and video calls, group chats, and in-app games. The app is designed to be easy to use, while also keeping user data safe with strong privacy controls. It even supports language translation, so people can communicate across different languages.
